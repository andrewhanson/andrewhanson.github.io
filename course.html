<blockquote>
.NET Core and ASP.NET Core give you a blazing fast and modular platform for creating server applications that run on Windows, Linux and Mac - Microsoft Marketting Site

</blockquote>

<p>
Do you really have time to investigate everything there is to know about developing ASP.Net Core, cross platform, .net standard, Xamarin applications running on a Mac using a docker image deployed to Microsoft Azure with Visual Studio Code leveraging the latest DotNetCompilerPlatform with a self-contained developer mode and the ability to deploy to a cheap Linux VM host.  
<br/>
…. And that’s before you even get started with Javascript or actually delivering anything of value to your customers.

</p>



<h2>Seriously are  you a robot!</h2>

If  you are anything like me you might actually want to spend some time away from your computer once you’re done working.  But at the same time you don’t consider the <i>Visual Studio -> File New</i> dialog to actually be a realistic start to a new project. 

<p>

<strong>Take this course if you are:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>	Interested in ASP.NET Core but actually have a real job
	<li>	New to the .Net developer platform and just want to kick the tires on the latest model
	<li>	You care more about delivering value to your users then clever programming tricks
	<li>	Willing to share your code publicly 
    </ul>
</p>
<strong>Do not take this course if:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>	You can enumerate all the different version of the .Net Framework with using <span style="text-decoration:line-through">Google</span> Bing
	<li>	You don’t actually want to build working software
	<li>	You like to compile all your dependent libraries from source. 
	<li>	Want to keep your work to yourself
</ul>

<h2>Not Another Programming Course</h2>
<div>
All the information you need to build ASP.Net Core applications is already out there. But I love the quote from Derek Sivers where he says, 

<blockquote>“If information were the answer, we’d all be billionaires with perfect abs”</blockquote>
<p>
Or in our case, <strong>“If information were the answer, we’d all be expert ASP.Net Core developers”</strong> ready and able to wow our customers with excellent software delivered onetime and under budget. 
</p>
<p>
You need to know the fastest way to get started and where to go for more information when you project takes you off the beaten path. 
</p>
<blockquote>You Time is your most valuable Asset</blockquote>
<p>
You can always make more money and more friends but you can never make more time. You need a course that doesn’t waste your time defining what CSS is, how to declare a variable, use GitHub or opine the intricate beauty of Dependency Injection. You need to have a technology explained once clearly and then forced to develop some working product using that technology. 
</p>
<p>
<h2>Are You Committed Enough to Put In the Work</h2>
</p><p>
It doesn’t matter how concise and clear the information and samples in the Bootstrapping ASP.Net Core course are created if you are not willing to put in the work to actually create on your own. To benefit from this course you have to be able to put in the work. 
 Do you actually have enough discipline to work?  
</p><p>
In the Bootstrapping ASP.NET Core course you will be given information and the accountability necessary to actually put that information into practice. That’s right just like high school there will be homework and it will be checked.
